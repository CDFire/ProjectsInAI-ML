Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter\\'s latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer\\'s \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he\\'s legally an adult: \"I just think I\\'m going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

        "No matter what I did for task one (decreasing dataset size, different batch sizes and techniques, turning on streaming for loading the dataset) Google Colab ran out of RAM on CPU or ran out of memory when ran on the GPU. I spent so much time trying to get this to work on Colab but I just couldn't get it to finish without running out of memory. Because of this, I obviously don't have results to discuss, so I am going to discuss my understanding of the impact of the hyperperameters and the choice of LLM.\n",

        "The learning rate dictates how quickly the model adjusts its weights during training. A high learning rate may lead to rapid convergence but risks overshooting the minima, resulting in instability or divergence. Conversely, a too-low learning rate can slow down convergence, potentially trapping the model in local minima.\n",
        "\n",
        "The batch size influences the gradient estimation during optimization. Larger batches provide a more stable and representative gradient, reducing variance but potentially leading to less frequent updates, which might affect generalization. Smaller batches introduce more noise, which can sometimes help the model escape shallow local minima and improve generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regularization techniques are essential to avoid overfitting. They help the model generalize better on unseen data by penalizing complexity. For instance, dropout randomly deactivates a subset of neurons during training, which forces the model to develop redundant representations and reduces reliance on any single pathway.\n",
        "\n",
        "Number of Layers and hidden units determine the capacity of the model. A deeper or wider network can capture more complex patterns but also increases the risk of overfitting and computational costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice of LLM inherently influences the outcomes in several ways. Different LLMs are pretrained on various datasets and may have different objectives during pretraining. This means that the model’s internal representations and understanding of language can vary significantly, affecting performance on downstream tasks. In adition, LLMs come with built-in assumptions based on their architecture. For example, transformer-based models are excellent at capturing long-range dependencies, which might be beneficial for certain tasks, while other architectures may have different strengths and limitations. An LLM’s performance in a specific task can also depend on how well it adapts during fine-tuning. Some models might be more robust or easier to fine-tune, which could lead to better performance."

        "The state space includes all the relevant information about the car and its environment at a given time. This includes the car’s position and velocity, nearby obstacles or vehicles, lane markings, traffic light status, and road conditions. The action space consists of the possible maneuvers the car can perform such as changing lanes, accelerating, decelerating, or making turns. The transition model defines how the car’s actions change its state over time like accelerating increases speed, while turning changes direction. These transitions can also depend on stochastic elements like the behavior of other drivers or sudden changes in the environment. The reward function reflects the desirability of outcomes. For example, the agent may receive positive rewards for staying in the correct lane, obeying traffic laws, and progressing toward the destination, and negative rewards for unsafe maneuvers, collisions, or going off-road.\n",

        "\n",
        "Managing sepsis is a complex decision-making problem. Physicians must continuously decide on medication dosages, like vasopressors and IV fluids, based on the evolving state of the patient. The challenge lies in accounting for long-term effects of treatment—some interventions may help in the short term but harm the patient later. Traditional supervised learning methods struggle with this sequential, decision-dependent nature of the problem. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, can model these treatment decisions as a sequential decision-making process and learn an optimal policy that improves patient outcomes over time.\n",

        "One of the most well-known projects in this area is by researchers at MIT and Harvard. It is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/matthieukomorowski/AI_Clinician and uses the MIMIC-III dataset—a rich database of de-identified ICU patient records.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective of the project is to train a reinforcement learning agent to recommend treatment policies for sepsis patients in the ICU. The researchers modeled the problem as an MDP where the agent observes patient state (from historical records) and recommends actions (drug dosages). The model used fitted Q-iteration to learn the optimal policy offline from historical data. Patient states were clustered into a discrete space using k-means, and actions were discretized combinations of IV fluid and vasopressor dosages. The learned policy was then compared with actual clinician decisions. The RL agent’s treatment policy, in many cases, aligned with best-practice care but also suggested more conservative medication use in some situations. When evaluated retrospectively, patients who received treatments closer to the AI’s policy showed improved outcomes. This project demonstrated that reinforcement learning could potentially assist or augment clinical decision-making. While it’s not used in production due to ethical and safety concerns, it remains a significant step toward intelligent clinical decision support systems."

        "Lower RMSE and MAE values indicate that the predictions are, on average, closer to the actual ratings. The SVD model has lower RMSE and MAE than the ALS model. This suggests that, on this dataset the SVD model’s predictions are more accurate. The matrix factorization approach implemented via SVD captures the underlying user-item interactions better than the ALS implementation. Because RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily than MAE, the fact that both metrics are lower for the SVD model reinforces the conclusion that it not only has a lower average error but also fewer large prediction errors.\n",
